    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <p>Learning syntax is the first step, but it is incredibly important to learn to create readable code. Writing code is like writing a paper. Getting the code down and the logic correct is your first draft, but what makes good code stand out from bad code is the extra effort put in to revise and refactor it into something that is robust, readable, and reusable.</p>

<div class="half-width"><h1>Know our</h1><h1>Global Cummunity</h1>
<p>A global community is a rule-bound society of individual people who come together to share a particular set of concerns.

  People often identify with their culture and nation, but now they can also identify as participants in the "global community." This new identity is important because it opens up more avenues for constructive dialogue and facilitates possibilities for cooperation amongst those who would otherwise be competing rivals.
